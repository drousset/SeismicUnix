@README_SUN   						8 June 1995

Users of SUN products are encouraged to read this collection of
notes thoroughly before attempting to install the CWP codes.
This collection of notes, though incomplete, should be helpful.

This set of notes is geared for SUN_SPARC users. Users of
other SUN products may have unique installation experiences.
We have some information regarding the compatibility of our
codes with SOLARIS. This may be found in README_SOLARIS

The default C compiler that comes with pre-SOLARIS versions of
the SUN operating system is not ANSI-compatible, so you
will need to obtain an ANSI C compiler before you can attempt
an installation of the CWP/SU codes.

There are 2 alternatives:
1) purchase the "acc" compiler from SUN
2) download the free "gcc" compiler from prep.ai.mit.edu
   and install this on your system.

For either case, you may install the codes on your system by
making changes in the Makefile.config file.

Your C compiler (either acc or gcc) lies on some path:
/some/path/to/acc or /some/path/to/gcc, where
"/some/path/to" is whatever the real path is to the compiler.

In Makefile.config

Uncomment:
OPTC = -O -DSUN

Change  the line:     CC = cc
to:                   CC = /some/path/to/acc
or:                   CC = /some/path/to/gcc        whichever is appropriate.

(Here we don't mean that you literally have /some/path/to, but that
this be the path to the compiler.)

You may specify the load libarary path explicitly via:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH = /lib/path1:/lib/path2:

where the /lib/path's are the library paths are the ones that are
appropriate for your compiler, including X libraries. 
The alternate approach is to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH as an
environment variable in your shell environment.

To add $(CWPROOT)/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH change the line:
#LD_LIBRARY_PATH += $(CWPROOT)/lib
to:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH += $(CWPROOT)/lib

change:
#IX11 = /usr/openwin/include
to:
IX11 = /usr/openwin/include

change:
#LX11 = /usr/openwin/include
to:
LX11 = /usr/openwin/include

############
% make xtinstall

Many warnings from the    make  xtinstall     phase of the
installation have been eliminated. Please let me know if you
find others.

### older model SUN stations. SUN 2 etc. without acc
Some older model SUN systems may not have  the fgetpos() and fsetpos()
subroutines defined in their native libraries. If you have
upgraded to SOLARIS, you should read README_SOLARIS for instructions
on installation.

You may try to install the GNU GLIBC package
as well as the gcc compiler you will have no trouble with the
non-X windows portions of our package.

However, because of an incompatibliity with the SUN X-windows distribution
if you are installing with GCC, don't use the GLIBC libraries when
you install the X-windows codes. Our X codes will not compile.

Two programs in the SU distribution will not work without GLIBC.
These are suinterp (a trace interpolation program) and suradon (a
radon transform application). Both of these programs depend on
the VND functions that are outlined in CWPROOT/src/par/lib/VND.c
and CWPROOT/src/par/include/VND.h. We are currently working on
providing non-VND versions of suinterp and suradon for users in
this position.

Probably the real answer here is to reinstall X windows from one
of the Xfree distributions, but I know of no users who have done this,
so I can't advise you further on this course of action.

##### installing without GLIBC
However, if you do not have the GNU libraries, then the following fix
will work, as well. 

Simply make sure that your OPTC path is set to:

OPTC = -O  -DSUN_A -DSUN

Some users may be installing without GLIBC and not know it, because
someone else has installed the GCC compiler for them. The
way you can tell if you are installing without GLIBC is that
you will get error messages involving one or more of the following 
items:

efgetpos()
efsetpos()
strtoul()
atopkge.o
strerror()
errpkge.o

However, as said above, the programs "suinterp" and "suradon" will
not work.

A goal for a future release is to have non-VND versions of suinterp
and suradon for users to use instead of the VND versions.

Many thanks to Joe Dellinger of Mobil for his many helpful suggestions
in inproving the SUN installation.

Update:
Regarding precompiled versions of GCC for SUN products, Garry Parratt
reports:
   I got both gcc and glibc from the Solaris Porting Project site at
   http://sun.icsnet.com/software/index.html. I guess the latter covered the
   problems you mentioned. All the software comes as binaries in Solaris
   'pkgadd' format so there's no compiling, no hassle, just great software!
