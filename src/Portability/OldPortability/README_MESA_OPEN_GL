Release 31 of the CWP/SU package has 3D graphics capability 
thanks Zhaobo Meng's implementation of  MESA or Open GL.

Mesa is a free 3D graphics library. See this website for information
about the package:

     http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html

The compressed tarfiles for Mesa are available from:

     ftp://iris.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/Mesa/

Open GL is a hardware graphics system which is similar to Mesa
and is available, built-in, on a number of platforms, including 
Silicon Graphics systems.

In addition to the Mesa or OpenGL package, you will need a set of the
GLUT (Open GL Utility Tookit) libraries.

These may be obtained from:

http://reality.sgi.com/mjk_asd/glut3/glut3.html

In Makefile.config are the following variables for defining
the paths to the Mesa/GL and GLUT include files and library
functions. These are peculiar to your installation of the package.
Please note that there is usually a "GL" directory containing
include files, so the IGL and IGLUT directory paths point to
the directory above this.

... from Makefile.config ...
####
## Open GL/Mesa include and library paths
# Open GL/Mesa include path
IGL = /usr/local/include

# Open GL/Mesa library path
LGL = /usr/local/lib

## GLUT include and library paths
# include path
IGLUT = /usr/local/include

# library path
LGLUT = /usr/local/include

....

You will also need to choose which Linking flags you will need:

######################################################################
# Linking Flags
... use this for installs using the free Mesa package
# installations using the free Mesa package
MGLLFLAGS= $(PRELFLAGS) -L$L -L$(LX11) -L$(LGLUT) -L$(LGL) \
                -lXmu -lX11 -lglut -lMesaGLU -lMesaGL   \
                -ltrack -lpar -lcwp -lm $(POSTLFLAGS)

... use this for installs using Open GL (for example on an SGI machine)
# installations using Open GL (use this on SGI machines)
