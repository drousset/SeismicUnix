README  Linux						13 June 1997

Check to see that the symbolic link between bash and sh
exists in /bin. The comman for making this is
(as the super user)

# ln -s  /bin/bash /bin/sh

Older versions of Slackware will require this. Newer versions
come with this link in place.


Follow the instructions in README_GNU_MAKE.

Follow the instructions in README_LITTLE_ENDIAN.

Follow the instructions in README_X
Caveat: on Linux systems you will have to set the DefaultColorDepth
parameter to 8 in XF86Config. This file may be found either in
/etc/   or in /usr/lib/X11. CWP/SU graphics are 8 bit graphics.
You will just see a black window with several of our codes if this
is not set properly.

X-toolkit installation:

make xtinstall

I have cleaned up the X codes considerably from the pre-Release 26
versions of the codes. If you get warnings or errors, let me know
because I am under the (possibly mistaken) impression that the
installation is totally quiet now.

If you have questions or comments please feel free to email me.
