README   C++                                       17 Feb 1995

To use the CWP/SU libraries with C++ programs, you will
need to install the contents of the CWPROOT/src/Complex directory. This
will install the include file Complex.h and the library, libcomplex.a.
CWPROOT/src/Complex/main contains an test example showing a C++
program that uses calls to the CWP libraries. So far, we can
guarantee that this will work only with the g++ compiler, as there
is no ANSI standard yet for C++.

You may use any of the subroutines in libcwp.a, libpar.a, libpsplot.a
and libsu.a as calls in C++ programs.

To install the contents of CWPROOT/src/Complex you must first have
installed the rest of the CWP/SU package successfully.
Check to see that the correct path to the g++ compiler is
given in the CC++ line of CWPROOT/src/Makefile.config.
Then

% cd  CWPROOT/src/Complex
% make
